Our initial findings:
#[1] Several papers correlate climate factors with disease incidence/prevalence

#[2] Temperature/Humidity are better disease vector indicators than rainfall

#[3] Temperatures 
	#Higher than 89F across Aedes and anopheles spp.
	#Higher than 101F for Aedes spp.
	#Lower than 60F
		Correlate with low/reduced Aedes populations. These are indicated at the GREEN LEVEL
		
#[4] Humidity
	# Greater than 75%
	#Less than 40%
		Correlate with low/reduced Aedes populations. These are indicated at the GREEN LEVEL

#[5] RED LEVEL indicators are:
	#Temperature = 71F to 89F
	#Humidity = 40% to 60%
    These values are consistent with spikes in Aedes aegypti populations
    Values not GREEN or RED are indicated ORANGE (moderate risk)

#[6] Rainfall may be a better indicator of an outbreak 2-3 weeks in advance but publications show variable results. 
	#Hence rainfall is included with values of YES or NO and corresponding prediction of 2-3 weeks from now. 
	
Target vector: Aedes Aegypti; Target location: Burundi
